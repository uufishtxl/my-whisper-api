 Okay, Joey. Hmm. Thanks. Listen, I need to ask you something. Okay, you know how my stepdad's in prison? Yeah. Well, um, listen, he was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could come to the wedding tomorrow. But he just called and, um... Well, apparently, stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday. So he can't come? No. And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And, um... Well, I would just really love it if you would do it. Seriously? Yeah, you've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom. I am pretty wisdom-ous. So, what do you say? Are you kidding, Phoebe? I would be honored. I'm not. Are you kidding, Phoebe? I would be honored. Oh, thank you.
