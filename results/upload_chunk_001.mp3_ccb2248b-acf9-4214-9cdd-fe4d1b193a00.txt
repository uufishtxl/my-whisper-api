 Ooh. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me. Listen, I hope... I hope that you know. I don't want you to see your father cry. Go to your room! I'm not a joke, you're broke. Your love lives the way. It's like you're always stuck in second gear. When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but... I'll be there for you. When your love starts to pour. I'll be there for you. Like I've been there before. I'll be there for you. Cause I'll never forget you.
